# Analysis of Structures Under Seismic Loading Using Fast Nonlinear Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on the nonlinear analysis of structures subjected to seismic loading using Fast Nonlinear Analysis (FNA) techniques. The goal is to simulate the seismic behavior, evaluate structural response, and optimize material usage.


## Overview
This project simulates the dynamic response of structures under seismic loads using Fast Nonlinear Analysis. It aims to identify critical points of failure, assess compliance with design codes, and optimize material usage without compromising structural integrity.

## Features
- Nonlinear analysis of structures under varying seismic intensities
- Identification of critical stress and deformation zones
- Optimization of material use based on stress distribution
- Compliance check with seismic design standards




## Results
The project provides detailed reports on:
- Displacement and stress distribution
- Critical failure points under seismic loading
- Optimized material usage with a focus on weight reduction
